## 🚀 Strategic Approach

### What is LLMO?
**Large Language Model Optimization (LLMO)** is the practice of making content discoverable, quotable, and trustworthy for AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard. As 67% of Gen Z students use AI chatbots for academic research, LLMO becomes crucial for institutional visibility.
